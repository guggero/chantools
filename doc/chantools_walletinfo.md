## chantools walletinfo

Shows info about an lnd wallet.db file and optionally extracts the BIP32 HD root key

### Synopsis

Shows some basic information about an lnd wallet.db file,
like the node identity the wallet belongs to, how many on-chain addresses are
used and, if enabled with --withrootkey the BIP32 HD root key of the wallet. The
latter can be useful to recover funds from a wallet if the wallet password is
still known but the seed was lost. **The 24 word seed phrase itself cannot be
extracted** because it is hashed into the extended HD root key before storing it
in the wallet.db.
In case lnd was started with "--noseedbackup=true" your wallet has the default
password. To unlock the wallet set the environment variable WALLET_PASSWORD="-"
or simply press <enter> without entering a password when being prompted.
