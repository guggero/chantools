## chantools removechannel

Remove a single channel from the given channel DB

### Synopsis

Opens the given channel DB in write mode and removes one
single channel from it. This means giving up on any state (and therefore coins)
of that channel and should only be used if the funding transaction of the
channel was never confirmed on chain!

CAUTION: Running this command will make it impossible to use the channel DB
with an older version of lnd. Downgrading is not possible and you'll need to
run lnd v0.19.0-beta or later after using this command!
