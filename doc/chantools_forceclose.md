## chantools forceclose

Force-close the last state that is in the channel.db provided

### Synopsis


If you are certain that a node is offline for good (AFTER you've tried SCB!)
and a channel is still open, you can use this method to force-close your
latest state that you have in your channel.db.

**!!! WARNING !!! DANGER !!! WARNING !!!**

If you do this and the state that you publish is *not* the latest state, then
the remote node *could* punish you by taking the whole channel amount *if* they
come online before you can sweep the funds from the time locked (144 - 2000
blocks) transaction *or* they have a watch tower looking out for them.

**This should absolutely be the last resort and you have been warned!**
